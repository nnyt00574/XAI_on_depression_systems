XAI for Depression Detection
📌 Overview

This project explores the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to detect signs of depression from data (e.g., text, survey responses, or clinical features). The aim is not only to build an accurate predictive model but also to provide transparent explanations for its decisions, making it interpretable for clinicians, researchers, and end-users.

💡 Motivation

Mental health disorders such as depression affect millions globally, but diagnosis often relies on subjective evaluation.
By combining AI with explainability methods, this project seeks to:

Assist clinicians with data-driven insights.

Highlight important features that contribute to predictions.

Build trustworthy and interpretable AI systems in mental health.

📊 Dataset

Source: (e.g., Kaggle, open clinical datasets, survey data – fill in what you used).

Features: (text responses, demographic details, clinical scores, etc.).

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, normalization, or feature scaling depending on the modality.

🧠 Methodology

Modeling:

Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and/or

Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers).

Explainability Techniques:

SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)

LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

Attention visualization (if NLP-based)

🔍 Explainability (XAI)

Global explanations: Identify the most influential features across the dataset.

Local explanations: Highlight why the model classified a particular individual as depressed or not.

Visualization: Graphs, heatmaps, and interactive plots to aid interpretability.

📈 Results

Model performance (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC).

Key insights from XAI visualizations (e.g., certain words or symptoms strongly linked to predictions).
